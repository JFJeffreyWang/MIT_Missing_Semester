# version control

[MIT: Missing Semester_Lectrue6: version control](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)

![git](git.assets/git.png)

## basic operation

`git init`

`git status`

`git add <file>`

`git commit `

`git cat-file -p 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad` cat-file by hash 

`git log --all --graph --decorate` show the commit history by **graph**

> `--oneline` show compact graph

`git checkout <hash/name>` switch HEAD node to <hash>

`git checkout -f <hash/name>` switch by force

`git checkout <filename>` replace \<filename\> with itself in HEAD node

`git diff (<hash/HEAD/master/...>)? <filename>`  compute the diff from `<hash>`  to **now**

`git diff <hash1> <hash2> <filename>` compute the diff from \<hash\> to  \<hash2\>



## branch

`git branch` or `git branch -vv`(for more information) to display the current branch

`git branch <name>` to create new branch

> `git checkout -b <name>`  same as `git branch <name>; git checkout <name>`

`git checkout <name>` to switch the HEAD node to \<name\> branch

`git merge <hash/name>` to merge HEAD with \<name\>

 

## remote

`git remote add <name> <url>`  like this: `git remote origin ../remote`

`git push <remote_name> <local_branch>:<remote_branch>` like this: `git push origin HEAD:master` 

`git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master` to set 'local branch' to track remote branch 'master'

when the above setting is completed

`git push` or `git push origin` also works 

`git fetch` or `git fetch origin`to update repository by retrieving specific remote branch

`git pull` equals to  ` git fetch; git merge origin/master` 

`git clone <url> ` to clone the whole version history

- [ ] `git clone --depth 1 ` It should only clone the latest snapshot, but the measurement is useless, **WHY?**

## Some other things

`.gitignore` file

```
.DS_Store
*.o
```



[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is **highly recommended reading**. Going through Chapters 1â€“5 should teach you most of what you need to use Git proficiently, now that you understand the data model. The later chapters have some interesting, advanced material.
